				NASA Announces Call for Next Phase of Commercial Lunar Payload Services
			</h2>

			<p>NASA has announced the latest opportunity for industry to participate in its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) efforts to deliver science and technology payloads to and near the Moon.

			The newest announcement calls for companies to push the boundaries of current technology to support the next generation of lunar landers that can land heavier payloads on the surface of the Moon, including the South Pole, as part of the agencyâ€™s Artemis program, which will send the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024, setting the stage for future human exploration of Mars.</p>
